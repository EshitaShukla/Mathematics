Ever wondered, if it was possible to do your homework and assignments, without having to buy any of those expensive calculators? Wanna do you homework tommow, but oh wait - the battery of the calculator is gone? Don't worry, MATHEMATICS to your rescue!!

Mathematics is a powerful calculation tool built from scratch in **tkinter** - **Python3**. 
It is an open source project and every little contribution to the repository counts.


----------

**Getting Started**
===================

You require any one Python 3 interpreter and the following modules

 1. tkinter (Tkinter for python 2) 
 2. ttkthemes
 3. Canvas
 4. PIL
 5. matplotlib
 6. numpy

Installing the above for Windows: 

 - directly go to the actual location of your python folder (not the shortcut)
 - you will see a Scripts folder (search it if you can't find it)
 - in the scripts folder open your cmd 
  - for some computers the option can be seen in `shift` + right-click
    - for some however, you have to open the cmd from the serach menu and using the `cd` command, have to enter the same folder
 - Then, run the command: 
    `pip install module_name`

Installing the modules for Ubuntu:

- for tkinter (if the below don't work, replace `tkinter` with `python-tk`):
 - `sudo apt-get install tkinter` or
 -  `sudo pip install tkinter` 
 -  `sudo pip3 install tkinter`
 
- for ttkthemes :
 - `sudo apt-get install ttkthemes` 

- Other modules are easy to install, but if the above methods don't work - either google the error, or just start using `pycharm`/ `anaconda` :P

**Features**
============

Mathematics is capable of many tasks, and works completely **offline!**
This tool is made for scientists and students to use, without having to buy a scientific calculator. Its features include:

Plot Graphs
---------------


> - Navigate to the graph calculation page from the main menu
> - Input the values of the function (in terms of 'x') starting point, ending point, type of markings, colour of markings
> - After the input is given, click on the type of plotting that you prefer

Calculator
---------------


> - Enter the equation the way you want to 
> - the calculator will follow the BODMAS  rule to solve the equation
> - this calculator is unique since it can calculate trigonometric values like `sin()`, `tan()` & `cos()`. Also, it has already defined constants like `e`, `pi`. You can always add more constants

Solve Equations
---------------
> - Navigate to the type of equation
> - Enter the required inputs and calculate

Themes
---------------
> - There are around 10 themes for the app, that you you can choose from
> - Pick whichever suits your eye, from the given menu (My personal favourite is `Radiance`), 'cuz your eyes need comfort too - awwww...

**Other Features**
---------------
> - **Matrix Operations** (Really?? Yess)
>>  - Matrix **Multiplication**  (All Dimentions)
>>  - Matrix **Inverse** (All Dimentions)

> - **Complex Arithmetic** (as in - the complex domain)
